## 🔨 How Forging Works - Complete Mechanics Guide

### The Three-Phase Forging System

**The forge roblox** features a unique skill-based forging system requiring manual dexterity:

#### Phase 1: Smelting (Pumper Control)
Control the pumper to maintain optimal temperature. Consistent timing ensures better base stats.

#### Phase 2: Pouring (Temperature Management)
Pour molten metal into the mold at the right moment. Perfect timing improves weapon quality.

#### Phase 3: Hammering (Precision Strikes)
Shape your weapon with precisely-timed hammer strikes. Better performance yields higher stats.

### Ore Combination Mechanics

Understanding how **ores the forge** system calculates final stats:

**Multiplier Averaging**
- Multipliers DON'T stack - the game uses the AVERAGE multiplier
- Example: 1x Arcane Crystal (7.5x) + 3x Stone (0.2x) = Average 2.025x
- Strategy: Keep ore multipliers in similar ranges for best results

**Trait Activation Thresholds**
- **10%+** of total ores: Trait activates at minimum effectiveness
- **20%+** of total ores: Good effectiveness
- **30%+** of total ores: OPTIMAL effectiveness (maximum trait power)

**Probability Distribution**
- Lower ore counts (3-10): Favor light weapons and armor
- Medium counts (15-30): Balanced distribution across weapon types
- Higher counts (30-51): Heavy weapons and colossal swords

### Forging Tips from The Forge Wiki

Based on extensive **the forge wiki** community research:

**Maximize Trait Bonuses**
Ensure key ores reach 30%+ of your total for optimal trait activation. Example: Want Rivalite's +20% Crit Strike? Use 30+ Rivalite in a 100-ore forge.

**Balance vs. Power**
Mix similar-tier ores rather than combining one legendary with many commons. Average multiplier matters more than single high values.

**Target Specific Classes**
Use our **[forge calculator](https://theforgecalculator.info)** to see exact probabilities for each weapon/armor class based on your ore count.

**Performance Matters**
Your mini-game performance significantly impacts final stats - practice makes perfect!
